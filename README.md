# Fares Djefaflia

Hello, my name is **Fares**. I love logic and analysis.

I am a **network technician** and a **web developer**, and **UX/UI designer**.  
I enjoy learning and contributing to open-source projects.

I worked for two years at ["**Algerie Telecom**"](https://www.algerietelecom.dz/ar), and the first website I programmed was in 2019.

I am proficient in using computers and the internet for various purposes, mostly in programming and design.  
I am skilled in core programming languages for front-end web development, and I am proficient in using the [**Vue.js**](https://vuejs.org/), [**Nuxt.js**](https://nuxt.com/), and [**TailwindCSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/) frameworks.

I also have proficiency in using various Adobe programs such as **Figma** and **Illustrator**.

Currently, I am learning backend development using [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/).
