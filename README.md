# Fares Djefaflia

Hello, my name is **Fares**, I love logic and analysis.
I'm also a **network technician**, **website developer**, and interested in UX/UI design, and I love open source projects.

I worked for two years at Algeria Telecom, and the first website I programmed was about 3 years ago.

I am good at using a computer and the Internet in several things, mostly in programming and design, and I am good at basic programming languages for a front-end web developer, and I am good at using the **[@Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/ "@Vue.js")** and **[@Nuxt.js](https://nuxt.com/ "@Nuxt.js")** and **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/ "Tailwind CSS")** frameworks.

I am currently working on several projects, including the **[@ESaturn](https://github.com/esaturn "@ESaturn")**, which supports and assists web developers, and I am working on the " Hadinat **[@Gheyth](https://github.com/gheyth "@Gheyth")** " platform and its religious-spiritual content, and many other projects, that you can find in **[my portfolio](# "my portfolio")**.

In the future, I plan to learn the back-end development of websites and enter the world of flutter
